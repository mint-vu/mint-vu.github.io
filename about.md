### About us
We are the Machine Intelligence and Neural Technologies (MINT) Lab at [Vanderbilt University](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/). Our overarching focus is on mathematical machine learning and (geometric) deep learning. We strive for Next-Generation Machine Learning algorithms (Next-Gen ML) that address current deficiencies in our technologies regarding sample/label efficiency, explainability, brittleness, and lifelong/continual learning.

### Research

![Research](/images/others/research.jpg)

Our research is motivated by the ever-increasing demand for automated understanding of data and predictive/generative modeling in real-world problems with a focus on biomedical application. We generally focus on developing practical Machine Learning (ML) and Computer Vision (CV) solutions for challenging problems.  Our current and past research towards NextGen-ML fall under the following broad research directions:

- Label efficient learning
  - zero/few-shot transfer learning, domain adaptation, and self-supervised learning
- Explainable ML
  - invertible models, explainable graph/convolutional neural networks
- Lifelong/Continual Learning
  -  Overcoming catastrophic forgetting, memory replay, selective transfer
- Adversarial Attacks and Defenses
  - Real-world object level adversarial attacks, Trojan attacks and defenses

Please refer to our [publications](/publication/) for a complete list of papers covering these topics.


### Lab Members

We strive to build a remarkably interdisciplinary research group spanning computer science, statistics, applied mathematics, biomedical sciences, and many other disciplines. Visit our [people page](/people/) to see more information on each person who works in the lab (publications, contact information, photos).

<!-- ### Lab Culture

We strive to create a lab a wonderful spot for anyone who is super driven by curiosity and likes to learn/move through ideas quickly. Instead of one big "lab project", everyone is generally the chief of their own individual projects. -->
